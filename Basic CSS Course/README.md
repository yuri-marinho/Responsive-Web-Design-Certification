## 🎯 Goal
In this course, I learned that CSS tells the browser how to display your webpage. The objective was to understand that I can use CSS to set the color, font, size, and other aspects of HTML elements.
By designing a [menu page for a cafe webpage](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/tree/main/Basic%20CSS%20Course/Cafe%20Menu) with Free Code Camp, I was able to assimilate the basic of CSS.

## 🎖️ Extra
To boost my learning, I created a new webpage with the concepts I used to build the [Cafe Menu](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/tree/main/Basic%20CSS%20Course/Cafe%20Menu). Check it out in the [StartingXI](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/tree/main/Basic%20CSS%20Course/StartingXI) folder!
