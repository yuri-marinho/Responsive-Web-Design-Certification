## 🎯 Goal
In this course, I learned different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other. The objective was to understand that I can use various ways to set colors in my webpage with CSS.
By designing a [set of colored markers](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/tree/main/Basic%20CSS%20Course/Cafe%20Menu) with Free Code Camp, I was able to assimilate the different ways to set colors with CSS.
