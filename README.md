# Free Code Camp Certification - Reponsive Web Design 🖥️✨
In this [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design), I'm learning the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML for content and CSS for design.

## 🤓 Learnings:
In order to assimilate the certification, I'm building:

1. A [cat photo app](https://yuri-marinho.github.io/Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/HTML%20Course/CatPhotoApp.html), to learn the basics of HTML; 😺✅
2. A [menu page for a cafe webpage](https://yuri-marinho.github.io/Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/Basic%20CSS%20Course/Cafe%20Menu/cafemenu.html), to learn the basics of CSS; ☕✅
3. A a set of [colored markers](https://yuri-marinho.github.io/Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/CSS%20Colors%20Course/Colored%20markers/coloredmarkers.html), to learn different ways to set color values and different ways to pair them; 🖌️✅
4. A [signup page](https://yuri-marinho.github.io/Responsive-Web-Design-Certification/Registration%20Form%20Course/regis_form.html), to learn how to control what types of data people can type into HTML forms; 📋✅
5. A penguin, to learn modern techniques like CSS variables; 🐧
6. A quiz site, to learn best practices for accessibility; 🎯

Lastly, I'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
