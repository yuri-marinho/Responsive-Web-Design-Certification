# Free Code Camp Certification - Reponsive Web Design 🖥️✨
In this [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design), I'm learning the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML for content and CSS for design.

## 🤓 Learnings:
In order to assimilate the certification, I'm building:

1. A cat photo app, to learn the basics of HTML; 😺
2. A menu page for a cafe webpage, to learn the basics of CSS; ☕
3. A a set of colored markers, to learn different ways to set color values and different ways to pair them; 🖌️
4. A penguin, to learn modern techniques like CSS variables; 🐧
5. A quiz site, to learn best practices for accessibility; 🎯

Lastly, I'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

To complete the certification, I used the following technologies:

* Visual Studio Code;
* HTML5;
* CSS3;
