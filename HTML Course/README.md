## üéØ Goal
In this course, I learned that HTML tags give a webpage its structure. The objective was to understand that I can use HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to a webpage.
By building a [cat photo app](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/blob/main/HTML%20Course/CatPhotoApp.html) with Free Code Camp, I was able to assimilate the most common HTML tags.

## üéñÔ∏è Extra
To boost my learning, I created a new webpage with the concepts I used to build the [cat photo app](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/blob/main/HTML%20Course/CatPhotoApp.html). Check it out in the [S√£o Paulo City file](https://github.com/yuri-marinho/Responsive-Web-Design-FCC/blob/main/HTML%20Course/saopaulocity.html)!
